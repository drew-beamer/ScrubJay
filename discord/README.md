# ScrubJay Discord Bot

ScrubJay is a Discord bot designed and built for the California Birding community server. The bot
is built to exist in a single server, and is not designed to be used in multiple servers at once.

## Features

- Integration with [eBird's](https://ebird.org/home) API to create a rare bird alert system. The bot
  will post a message in a specified channel when a rare bird, meeting additional filter criteria,
  is reported in the state of California.
- More features coming soon!

## Contributing

Depending on interest, I may open source this bot. If you are interested in contributing, please
reach out to me on Discord.
